# Hello! I'm Catherine.

## About Me

### [ðŸ’¼ My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/03271111/)

<p> Experienced Contracts Administrator with a strong foundation in operational processes and compliance within secure, regulated environments. Currently transitioning into cybersecurity, leveraging a versatile professional background and CompTIA Security+ certification. </p>

<p> I am passionate about applying cybersecurity knowledge in practical settings, with a focus on building technical skills through hands-on projects in a VirtualBox home lab. This includes system hardening, secure authentication configuration, patch and package management, access control enforcement, and end-point security controls. I also perform log analysis, threat detection, and security automation, applying these skills in scenarios that reflect real-world security operations. My technical work is complemented by knowledge of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF 2.0), grounding my approach in established security standards. </p>

## Cybersecurity Portfolio

<p>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository highlights three hands-on projects designed to demonstrate real-world cybersecurity skills: </p>

- **System Security & Compliance:** Perform Linux system hardening audits and compliance checks using Lynis, with remediation and reporting.

- **SIEM & Threat Detection:** Build and test alerting and detection use cases using Splunk, simulating incident triage and monitoring workflows.

- **Automation & Scripting:** Develop Python scripts to automate security-related tasks, such as password auditing, log parsing, and report generation.

<p>Each project reflects my commitment to practical learning, applying security frameworks, and building experience in operational cybersecurity tasks.</p>
