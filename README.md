# Hello! I'm Catherine.

## About Me

### [💼 My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/03271111/)

<p> Experienced Contracts Administrator with a strong background in operational processes and compliance within secure, regulated environments. Currently seeking to transition into a cybersecurity role, drawing on a versatile professional foundation. </p>

<p> This background, as well as my recent CompTIA Security+ certification, complements my current study of cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27001. To gain practical experience, I developed a home lab which has allowed me to simulate security incidents and work with SIEM, EDR, log analysis, and threat detection tools. </p>

## Cybersecurity Portfolio

<p>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository showcases projects I’ve built to develop practical skills in cybersecurity, including automation, threat analysis, and lab experiments. Each project is designed to demonstrate hands-on experience and a commitment to learning real-world security workflows.</p>
