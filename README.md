## Cybersecurity Portfolio

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! My current focus is building practical skills for security operations while developing complementary governance and risk experience. This repository showcases hands-on cybersecurity projects spanning SOC operations, configuration management, automation, and GRC practices.

**üîê System Security & Compliance:** Perform Linux system hardening audits and NIST CSF 2.0 compliance checks using Lynis, with remediation and reporting.

**‚ö° Automation & Scripting:** Develop Python scripts for security tasks, including myPort Inspector, a custom port scanning tool.

**üîé SIEM & Threat Detection:** Build and test alerting and detection use-cases using Splunk, simulating incident triage and monitoring workflows.
