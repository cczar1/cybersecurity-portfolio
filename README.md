# Hello! I'm Catherine.

## About Me

### [ðŸ’¼ My LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/03271111/)

<p> As a Contracts Administrator with experience in secure, compliance-driven operations, I am currently seeking to transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) analyst position. My experience managing risk-sensitive agreements and supporting audit readiness has given me a solid foundation in secure operations and policy adherence. </p>

<p> This background, as well as my recent CompTIA Security+ certification, complements my current study of cybersecurity frameworks such as NIST and ISO 27001. To gain practical experience, I developed a home lab which has allowed me to simulate security incidents and work with SIEM, EDR, log analysis, and threat detection tools. </p>

## Cybersecurity Portfolio

<p>Welcome to my Cybersecurity Portfolio! This repository showcases projects Iâ€™ve built to develop practical skills in cybersecurity, including automation, threat analysis, and lab experiments. Each project is designed to demonstrate hands-on experience and a commitment to learning real-world security workflows.</p>
